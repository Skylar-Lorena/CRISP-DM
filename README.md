# CRISP-DM
## Movie Studio Data Science Project

## Project Overview
This project uses the CRISP-DM framework to support business decision making for a new movie studio. The goal is to analyze historical movie data to understand which types of films perform well at the box office and to use those insights to guide future production decisions.

The analysis focuses on identifying relationships between movie genres, audience reception, and revenue performance. Findings from the data are translated into clear, actionable recommendations for business stakeholders.

## CRISP-DM Framework

### 1. Business Understanding
Define the business problem and identify the key questions the project aims to answer. In this project, the focus is on reducing financial risk by understanding what drives box office success.

### 2. Data Understanding
Explore and describe the datasets used in the analysis, including their sources, structure, and key characteristics. This phase evaluates how well the data can support the business question.

### 3. Data Preparation
Clean and prepare the data for analysis. This includes merging datasets, handling missing values, and transforming features so they are suitable for analysis.

### 4. Data Analysis
Analyze the prepared data to identify patterns and trends related to movie performance. This phase produces findings that inform business recommendations.

### 5. Evaluation
Assess whether the findings adequately address the business question and support meaningful recommendations for stakeholders.

### 6. Deployment
Present insights through visualizations and a non-technical presentation, and provide clear recommendations that stakeholders can use to guide decision making.
